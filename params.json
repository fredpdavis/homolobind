{"name":"HOMOLOBIND","tagline":"proteome-wide prediction of protein and ligand binding sites","body":"### What is HOMOLOBIND\r\nHOMOLOBIND identifies residues in protein sequences with significant similarity to structurally characterized binding sites. It transfers binding sites from LIGBASE (http://salilab.org/ligbase) and PIBASE (http://fredpdavis.com/pibase) through ASTRAL/ASTEROIDS (http://astral.berkeley.edu) alignments onto SUPERFAMILY (http://supfam.org) domain assignments.\r\n\r\nThe homology transfer procedure predicts residues in ligand and protein binding sites with estimated true positive rates of 98% and 88%, respectively, at 1% false positive rates.\r\n\r\nThis release is based on the SCOP v1.73 domain classification.\r\n\r\n**NOTE: HOMOLOBIND is maintained here for archiving purposes. The databases that HOMOLOBIND depends on have dramatically changed or stopped development.**\r\n\r\nHOMOLOBIND predictions for several species are archived at Zenodo:\r\nhttps://zenodo.org/record/29597\r\n\r\n\r\n### Citing HOMOLOBIND\r\nProteome-wide prediction of overlapping protein and ligand binding sites using structure.  \r\nDavis FP.
